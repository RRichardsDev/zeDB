# Devlog

Findings worth remembering, especially GPUI gaps and gotchas that could
become upstream contributions. Newest at the bottom.

## M0 (2026-08-05)

- gpui 0.2.2 is on crates.io and genuinely usable; no git dependency on
  the zed repo needed. The `Application::new().run` / `open_window` /
  `Render` API worked first try.
- Building gpui on macOS requires Apple's Metal toolchain, which no longer
  ships with the Command Line Tools:
  `xcodebuild -downloadComponent MetalToolchain` (688MB, one-time). The
  build error ("cannot execute tool 'metal'") does not hint at the fix.
  Candidate for a CONTRIBUTING.md note and maybe a friendlier build-script
  message upstream.
- Dev-profile gpui is unusably slow without optimization; workspace sets
  `[profile.dev.package."*"] opt-level = 2` so only our crates compile
  unoptimized.

## M1 (2026-08-05)

- Dropped the `clickhouse` crate in favor of a hand-rolled
  `RowBinaryWithNamesAndTypes` decoder (see SPEC amendment): the crate
  wants compile-time row structs; an explorer has runtime-discovered
  schemas.
- The ephemeral-server test pattern from analytics-clickhouse-ddl ports
  beautifully to Rust: temp dir + minimal config.xml/users.xml + random
  ports; full start-query-teardown in under a second. This will carry the
  Phase 1 replay engine too.
- RowBinary notes: UUIDs arrive as two little-endian u64 halves (reverse
  each 8-byte half for RFC order); LowCardinality is transparent on the
  wire (values serialize as the inner type); Nullable is a 0x00/0x01
  prefix byte per value.
- Type strings are parsed strictly; anything unknown (e.g.
  AggregateFunction states) fails loudly as UnsupportedType rather than
  guessing. The explorer will need a graceful UI story for those columns
  eventually.
